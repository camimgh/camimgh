Hi! My name is Cami Mejia and I'm a current sophomore at MIT studying computer science and media studies. 

As you can see, the website's a little bare. I'm currently working on developing the real website and it will replace this one once it's perfect.

Thanks for being patient!

You can find my resume [here](https://camimgh.github.io/camimgh/resume/).

Currently I am...
- mentoring and judging for [MIT THINK](https://think.mit.edu)
- blogging for [MIT Admissions](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/camim)
- running [@mitadmissions](https://instagram.com/mitadmissions) and hosting weekly Q&A livestreams with other MIT undergraduates
- assisting and running the Infinite Careers series for the [MIT Career Advising & Professional Development Offices](https://capd.mit.edu)
- planning events w/ the rest of the MIT 2023 Student Council as *Vice President*
- building this website!! or a different version of it. so it can look way nicer.
- learning Tagalog via [MangoLanguages](https://mangolanguages.com)

Have questions? Feel free to reach out to me at camim@mit.edu
