Hi! My name is Cami Mejia and I'm a current sophomore at MIT studying computer science and media studies. 

As you can see, the website's a little bare. I'm currently working on developing the real website and it will replace this one once it's perfect.

Thanks for being patient!

You can find my resume here.
